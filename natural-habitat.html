                <h2>Why This Example</h2>
                <p class="card-subtitle">Context and selection</p>
                <p>I found this example through Typ.io, which documents real typography in use across the web. Divami is a UX/UI design agency, and their site uses Noto Serif to communicate approachability without losing credibility.</p>
                <p>What caught my attention is how the type handles scale. The headline "Humanizing Technology" is massive but doesn't feel aggressive. The serifs give it refinement, while the open counters keep it inviting. It's exactly the kind of balance I wanted to explore in this project.</p>

                <h3>Typographic Analysis</h3>
                <p class="card-subtitle">How the type works</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Hierarchy:</strong> Bold red headline paired with a lighter subtitle creates clear visual layers without needing multiple typefaces.</li>
                    <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> The weight variation in Noto Serif (400 vs 700) gives the page rhythm, similar to how tattoo linework uses thick and thin strokes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Legibility:</strong> Even at large sizes, the letterforms stay crisp. The x-height is generous enough that body copy remains readable at smaller scales.</li>
                    <li><strong>Interaction:</strong> Minimal UI elements like the scroll indicator don't compete with the typography. Everything supports the reading experience.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Design Takeaways</h3>
                <p class="card-subtitle">What this example teaches</p>
                <p>This site proves Noto Serif is versatile enough to work in functional contexts, not just editorial layouts. The type anchors the design without overpowering it, which is what I wanted to achieve in the Polka Tattoo Typography Lab.</p>
                <p>The pairing of bold serif headlines with clean sans-serif UI elements shows how typography can create hierarchy without relying on color or imagery. That restraint mirrors the limited palette in polka tattoo work, where contrast comes from linework and negative space.</p>
                <p>What I learned here is that typography doesn't need to be decorative to have personality. Noto Serif brings warmth and structure to this product site, proving that even utilitarian design can feel human and intentional.</p>
